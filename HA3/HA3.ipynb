However, if one tries to use this approach with Q-learning, it's very likely that the optimization will be very unstable. To remediate this, two main ideas are used. First, we use experience replay, in order to decorrelate the experience samples we obtain when exploring the environment. Second, we use two networks instead of one, in order to fix the optimization targets. That is, for a given minibatch sampled from the replay buffer, we'll optimize the weights of only one of the networks (commonly denoted as the \"online\" network), using the gradients w.r.t a loss function. This loss function is computed as the mean squared error between the current action values, computed according to the **online** network, and the temporal difference (TD) targets, computed using the other, **fixed network** (which we'll refer to as the \"target\" network).\n",

The main reason for this is that the max operator, used to select the greedy action when computing the TD target, uses the same values both to select and to evaluate an action (this tends to prefer overestimated actions). In order to prevent this, we can decouple the selection from the evaluation, which is the idea that created DDQN. More concretely, the TD target for a DDQN is now \n",

This is what makes DDQN not overestimate (as much) the state action values, which in turn helps us to train faster and obtain better policies.\n",
